    This is a demo of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.06824">Melanoma Detection using Adversarial Training and Deep Transfer Learning</a> (Physics in Medicine and Biology, 2020).</br>
    We introduce an over-sampling method for learning the inter-class mapping between under-represented 
    class samples and over-represented samples in a bid to generate under-represented class samples 
    using unpaired image-to-image translation. These synthetic images are then used as additional 
    training data in the task of detecting abnormalities in binary classification use-cases. 
    Code is publicly available in <a href='https://github.com/hasibzunair/adversarial-lesions'>Github</a>.</br></br>
    This method was also effective for COVID-19 detection from chest radiography images which led to 
    <a href="https://github.com/hasibzunair/synthetic-covid-cxr-dataset">Synthetic COVID-19 Chest X-ray Dataset for Computer-Aided Diagnosis</a>. 
    The synthetic images not only improved performance of various deep learning architectures when used as additional training data
    under heavy imbalance conditions, but also detect the target class (e.g. COVID-19) with high confidence.</br></br>
    This demo model predicts if the given image has benign or malignant symptoms. 
    To use it, simply upload a skin lesion image, or click one of the examples to load them.
